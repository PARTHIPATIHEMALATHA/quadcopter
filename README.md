# Hii..Everyone..This is Hema Latha.p Here is about my FRT Project Details

# Project Synoposis: 
## Drones formally called quadcopter are unmanned aerial vehicles that are remotely controlled. They range in size from under one pound to several hundred pounds (Perlman 2016). This thesis addresses drones classified for consumer use, which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines as drones between 0.55 to 55 lbs. (FAA 2016e). Since consumer drones have been available for purchase in greater numbers than ever before, legislation related to no-fly zones needs to be centrally organized (Perlman 2016). This can be done through the creation of a geodatabase and web-GIS map, which will allow for visualization of drone use areas.in this project we explained about quadcopter ,classifications with bot service..
